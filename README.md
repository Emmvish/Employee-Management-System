The project is programmed using Java Swing Programming framework and the back-end of the project is associated with an employees' database in the MySQL application. There's a form panel in which a user can enter their details to get registered with the network. There's a table panel tab to the right of this form-panel where the administrator can view the details of all the current employees in the organization. Also, files with ".per" extension can be imported or exported to load and store employee's data respectively. Further, there's a refresh button on menu bar to update the MySQL database once the user has entered their details. The menu bar also offers the option to collapse the form-menu. Finally, there's another tab called "Servers" that lists all the active servers in the organization.
